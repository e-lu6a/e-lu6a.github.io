Most of the day spent traveling. Excited for a long period of waiting, of doing nothing, though flight was delayed and our landing was quite rocky. We attempted to land twice at Reagan, and finally diverted to Dulles. Mom &amp; dad both came to pick me up, and dad made wonton soup for me &ndash; how savory it was, how much it hit the spot. 香啊！How sweet home is.">

<p>Most of the day spent traveling. Excited for a long period of waiting, of doing nothing, though flight was delayed and our landing was quite rocky. We attempted to land twice at Reagan, and finally diverted to Dulles. Mom &amp; dad both came to pick me up, and dad made wonton soup for me &ndash; how savory it was, how much it hit the spot. 香啊！How sweet home is.</p>
<p>They both made a a really big fuss over my bedding - the mattress (plastic stil on! freshly to be removed!), the foam topper, the sheets, the duvet &ndash; and also the workstation set up.</p>
<p>C says often of my parents that they care for me very much - and I think I had taken all of this for granted. Even now, at 30 &ndash; though I certainly don&rsquo;t feel that way &ndash; their care and holding of me is such sweet, sweet relief, such sweet treasure.</p>
<p>I also feel a calm at home - unsure if it&rsquo;s because of this parental care, or the quietness of the suburbs - or the semi-enforced, pre-established routine that has me fed, socialized, and outside on any given day, leaving me wanting for naught -</p>
<p>Regardless - I am so grateful to be back.</p>
<h2 id="day-2---monday-feb-18">day 2 - monday, feb 18</h2>
<p>Woke up around 11 (8?), took a lazy breakfast/lunch with dad (puffed paratha with egg - 灌 guàn); some quiet computer time before being called out for a walk in the woods. Afterwards, a costco run - hotdogs, ice cream - and a big, inevitable nap at home, while mom worked on reworking my hat and listening to a Chinese television show (again, reminded  both mom &amp; dad are so eager to do literally anything for me, how tender, how heartbreaking, how sweet).</p>
<p>A big nap, waffling around, then dinner again - leftovers from yesterday night, a costco rotisserie chicken dipped in soy sauce and vinegar and garlic &amp; ginger paste - and then quiet time, again. I think dad&rsquo;s still up, watching TV - though it&rsquo;s 1pm EST, now - 10pm PST, I suppose.</p>
