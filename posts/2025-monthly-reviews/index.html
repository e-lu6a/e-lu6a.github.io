<p>a relatively quiet month - went back to MD for a large part of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>finally quit CJI,</li>
<li>tunan and jerry moved away (D;;;);</li>
<li>still helping out with miranda,</li>
<li>connor&rsquo;s el abrazo milonga (#3)</li>
<li>helped out at bouqs @ whole foods for valentine&rsquo;s day !!!</li>
<li>went home, seeing the last tail end of winter,</li>
<li>finally joined leopard.fyi slack group</li>
<li>calls with chris</li>
<li>did a singular park run, lol, so very out of shape</li>
<li>seeing luis, leah, daniel</li>
<li>checking out tango in DC</li>
<li>hanging out with mom and dad</li>
</ul>
<p>overall, still feeling very much in limbo. at work, steadily chugging on (with frequent reminders) to perform well and be a solid, reliable employee at mcgriff - while still attempting to nudge myself to try new things, explore, see what feels right or makes sense.</p>
<p>still some anxiety and depression, though perhaps not as bad at around december or earlier jan.</p>
<p>things with connor still unclear/uncertain.</p>
<p>nice being home.</p>
