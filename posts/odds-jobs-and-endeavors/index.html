i almost forgot to list this one, since this isn&rsquo;t one i actively really sought out or looked for. but it&rsquo;s been a pleasure to do, and a priviledge to keep doing.

helped various folks make sure their class was set up with zoom and the TV for presentations and meetings. after a while, getting up at 8am on Friday after a long week, just to help for half an hour on site, just wasn&rsquo;t quite worth it anymore. i would often also get asked to help for a couple of prime weekend or holiday hours days before, and the scheduling for that just didn&rsquo;t work out, either.">

<p>the highlight of this was the first event i helped with, though - a member&rsquo;s dinner, with a catered dinner (for us, too), and sitting next to the actual, skilled A/V person, Beth Cloutier, and chatting with her about her work, and her business. skilled, highly competent, independent - in charge of her own gigs - inspiring!</p>

<p>what a doozy! a lot of rain, storm, thorns &ndash; and a lot of fun. true pleasure in arranging flowers; easily swiped away by treating them as inventory - some thrill in efficient logisitics and operations.</p>
